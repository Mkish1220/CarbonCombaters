        {{!-- As cities heat up, it's {{questions}}tempting to keep the A/C on cold blast all year long, or the heat on full blast
        during the winter. But reducing usage of air conditioning and heating is the best way to reduce your overall
        electricity usage and is magnitudes more effective than turning off the lights during the day. Additionally,
        keeping computers turned off when not in use can greatly reduce your carbon footprint at home.</p>
